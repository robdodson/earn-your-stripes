# Earn Your Coder Stripes

## The Baseline

1. Get a sketchbook going
	- Sketchbook project on Github
	- codepen.io or jsfiddle.net
	- HTML5Boilerplate

2. Learn the basics of HTML/CSS
	- [Code Academy: Web Fundamentals](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
	- Treehouse


3. Learn jQuery with [jQuery Fundamentals](http://jqfundamentals.com/)

It'll be easier than learning raw JS. With jQuery you can get right into the browser and start doing stuff.

Also the [jQuery documentation](http://jquery.com/) is highly searchable!

4. Find Help

Good:
MDN
StackOverflow

Not So Good:
W3Schools

6. Befriend your code editor
[Sublime Text2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
[Coda2](http://panic.com/coda/)
[Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

It really doesn't matter what editor you use, so long as it makes **you** happy. Your code editor is your guitar or your favorite cutting knife. It's a very personal thing. Bond with it and ignore the haters.

7. Befriend your dev tools
